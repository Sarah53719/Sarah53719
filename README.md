- Iâ€™m interested in learning about coding because I want to be able to do mathematical modeling with code in the future
- Iâ€™m currently learning basic python
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on NOTHING but once I start learning more I want to look into many projects so I can understand more about software
- I have experience in hardware but I am currently focusing this summer on software and coding :)
